This is the assignment for STAT545b B4, option C. Please see details in <https://yuyt.shinyapps.io/assignment-b4-YuYT98/>

This assignment is based on assignment B3, with another 3 features:

-   Additional feature 1:

    Added "Statistic Summary Tool" figure for the page.

-   Additional feature 2:

    Added a line of text to summarize the total number of subjects in the uploaded data file.

-   Additional feature 3:

    Added a plot with the original data as the x-axis and predicted data as the y-axis, as well as a straight line y = x (here x is the value of original data) so that user can see how the predicted data performed against the original data. Ideally the closer the data to the line, the better prediction they have.
